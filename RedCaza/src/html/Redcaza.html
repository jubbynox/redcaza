	           redcaza enables you to hunt for and play media directly from the Internet. Media is never stored on your machine, it is
	           always streamed from its source.
	           <p>The Internet is changing the way we store and access media... fast. Today, many people have external drives holding gigabytes
	           of music and video that they have collected over the years - most of which they'll probably access rarely, if at all. They also
	           run the risk of losing it all in the event of a hard disk failure; except for the few who spend more on even larger storage
	           space and diligently make backups. However, a virtually infinite amount of music and video is already available through the
	           Internet, so why bother storing it at home if it is readily accessible whenever you are online? Whilst the phonographic
	           industry panics about piracy and people copying music illegally they lose sight of the direction that media distribution is
	           headed: with increasing ubiquity and speed of the Internet it will become more common for media to be <i>streamed</i> rather
	           than stored at home, more like a radio or television (with the exception that you tell it what to play).</p>
	           <p>redcaza is a a <a href="http://www.winamp.com/">Winamp</a> plug-in that takes a step in this direction.
	           It uses <a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/">VLC</a> to transcode certain media types into a format that Winamp can
	           understand; the <a href="/install_redcaza.exe" onclick="pageTracker._trackEvent('Download', 'redcaza', 'v1.0');"> redcaza installer</a>
	           will help you install VLC, if not already done so.</p>
	           <p>Start enjoying music you don't have, now! With nothing previously installed, you can get going within a couple of minutes.</p>

		      A "redcaza" item is added to the Winamp media library, as shown below, from which you can select different

              This section was going to be about the legality of this software, considering that no money is transferred to copyright owners.
              It was also going to be about how it could be fashioned to benefit all concerned
              (re: <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8128551.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8128551.stm</a>).
              Instead, it is about the philosophy behind the software. So, take a while to consider how many years of work and the fantastic discoveries that have preceeded this moment in order
              to not only enable the creation of music and its recording, but also to carry it to you in this way. You are entitled to enjoy
              these things (all things, not just music), regardless of what anyone else may say or how any economic system may attempt to control them.
              You are, after all, a person on this planet, just like everyone else. All that is really important is that you strive to better
              yourself and contribute whatever you can.
              <p>This is better put, though perhaps a little out of context, with the following quotation:</p>
              <blockquote>What we call civilization - the accumulation of knowledge which has come down to us from our forefathers - is
              the fruit of thousands of years of human thought and toil. It is not the result of the labour of the ancestors of any
              separate class of people who exist today, and therefore it is by right the common heritage of all. Every little child that is
              born into the world, no matter whether he is clever, or dull, whether he is physically perfect or lame, or blind; no matter how
              much he may excel or fall short of his fellows in other respects, in one thing at least he is their equal - he is one of the
              heirs of all the ages that have gone before.</blockquote>
              - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ragged_Trousered_Philanthropists"><i>The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists</i></a>, Robert Tressell.
              <p>i.e. money (and lack of it) is actually irrelevant and therefore should be of no object.
              <p>If you are still reading, and have some concerns, consider the following points when deciding whether or not to use this:
	           <dl>
	               <dt>redcaza uses published, legal APIs to hunt for media</dt>
	               <dd>All the media that redcaza finds can also be found using only an Internet browser. From that browser you could use Google
	                or YouTube, for example, to get exactly the same results. There is nothing unusual or illegal about the information that leaves
	                your computer.</dd>
	               <dt>redcaza does not store media on your computer</dt>
	               <dd>All the media that you play, using redcaza, is streamed (a small part may be held for buffering purposes, but is then
	                removed) - why store gigabytes of media locally when today's Internet speeds allow you to stream it from a remote source?
	                This also means that your computer never transmits media to anyone else. Again, the same can be done using only an Internet browser,
	                so there is nothing unusual in the way that redcaza works: from the browser you could listen to an MP3 on a website or go to YouTube.</dd>
	               <dt>redcaza enqueues remote media in Winamp</dt>
	               <dd>redcaza adds media links to Winamp playlists allowing you to mix locally stored and remote media from many different sources;
	                therefore, you can enqueue hours of audio and video from within a single application, rather than having to switch applications
	                to access media that is stored and managed elsewhere.</dd>
